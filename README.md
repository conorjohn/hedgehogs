# Hedgehogs
This is a small JS library to handle, manipulate or transform arrays. 

If you are wondering why the name, it is because a group of hedgehogs are called an array. Which means everything in an array is a hedgehog, and so here we are.

This library is aiming to be a functional way of processing and iterating over arrays. In order to manipulate Objects, well, you're going to have to wait, it's a work in progress.

# Use Hedgehogs in your project to help you manage arrays
Install via `npm install headgehogs --save`
